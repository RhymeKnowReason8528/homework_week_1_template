# Rhyme Know Reason Programming Training Week 1 Homework

## Broken Welcome
#### This program should print a simple line, but it doesn't seem to be working...
Before you do the challenge, select "Run Tests" from the Run Configurations dropdown and press run to see the test fail. 
You can look at why the test failed and fix it. You may need to repeat this process a couple of times as you find more things wrong.

Note that if there are any syntax errors anywhere in the project (including in other challenges) the tests will not be able to run, and you will not be able to run this program.

You can run this program by selecting "BrokenWelcome" from the Run Configurations dropdown and pressing the run button next to it (once all syntax errors are dealt with).

## Variables
#### For this challenge, you'll be creating variables of different types. 
Simply do as the comments say in the Variables file.

Please note that this challenge will be hand-graded, and does not have a test set up.
